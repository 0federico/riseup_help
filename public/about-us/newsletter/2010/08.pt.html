<h2><a name="infrastructure-work-august-16-20"></a> Infrastructure work: August 16 &#8211; 20!</h2>
<p>The riseup birds are going to be moving some things around in the nest during the week of August 16th &#8211; August 20th. What does that mean for you? It means that all of riseup&#8217;s services are going to have interruptions, including mail, lists, crabgrass. We will try to keep the interruptions as short as possible, but please don&#8217;t panic if something is not working! We will work hard to get everything working again quickly.</p>
<h2><a name="help-tickets"></a> Help Tickets</h2>
<p>Do you speak a language other than Portuguese or English? Have you posted a help ticket, and not received a response? Well, first of all, sorry. Really, truly, sorry. Our desire to provide world-wide access to our services does not keep pace with our small collective&#8217;s linguistic abilities, and thus we have not been providing adequate tech support to many languages that our users speak. This feels terrible, and we&#8217;d like to find people in all languages to answer help tickets, and definitely have that as a long term goal, but it is probably something that won&#8217;t happen so quickly.</p>
<p>One way to help is if folks can try to answer each others&#8217; help tickets. All riseup mail users can log into our account management system, from the &#8220;Change my settings&#8221; link on our mail page. From there, you can click on &#8220;Help Tickets&#8221; on the left, and see public help tickets. You can click the &#8220;show filter&#8221; link to select languages you know, and answer help questions from others. By sharing knowledge, we can spread the work and answer questions more quickly!</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re able to find someone in your community who could translate your question into (preferably) English, which we have the most tech support in, we&#8217;ll answer that more quickly, but we know that&#8217;s not a great solution. And we know you&#8217;re doing marvelous and important work, so, sorry.</p>
<h2><a name="news-from-the-collective"></a> News from the Collective</h2>
<p>We are meeting for our second ever Riseup retreat this month. It&#8217;s extra fun for us because we are a geographically scattered lot, and rarely get to communicate outside of internet chats and conference calls with bad audio. We&#8217;ll be putting our heads together for lots of meetings, as well as building some hardware, eating bagels, going night swimming, and doing some long-term visioning. At our first retreat, two collective members fell madly in love. We&#8217;re hoping this one will be at least that epic. Stay tuned for announcements about what new projects and schemes we&#8217;ll be taking on in the near future.</p>
<h2><a name="fundraising"></a> Fundraising</h2>
<p>Servers cost money. Bandwidth costs money. Stipends cost money. Corporate email and lists are free not because they don&#8217;t cost money, but because they data mine all users as much as they possibly can in order to sell this information to others. Yuck. Since you&#8217;re using Riseup you probably hate this as much as we do. If you can send in a donation this month to help cover some of our costs, we&#8217;d mightily appreciate it. Thanks.</p>
