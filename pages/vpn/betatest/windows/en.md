## Troubleshooting

### Get the logs

There is three log files each for a different component of the client:
* The systray log: `C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\leap\systray.log`
* The priviledged helper: `C:\Program Files\RiseupVPN\helper.log`
* The openvpn process: `C:\Program Files\RiseupVPN\openvp.log`
When reporting a bug is very useful to include the log files.
