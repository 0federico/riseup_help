The [[vpn-black]] uses the "Riseup Black" accounts and requires the [[Bitmask application => https://bitmask.net]], currently available for Linux and Android.

Bitmask VPN is easier to use and has greater security than traditional VPNs, but is not yet available for all platforms.

To sign up for Black services, visit [[black.riseup.net => https://black.riseup.net]].

For more information on how to use the Bitmask application, see [[bitmask.net => https://bitmask.net]].
