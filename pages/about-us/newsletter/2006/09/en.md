@title = 'September'

This newsletter is brought to you by the letter "s". It is for all
riseup.net list admins, mail account users, and website owners. It
contains vital information, handy tidbits, and useless trivia.

## one million subscriptions!

Holy smokes! In case you wondered why things are getting slow, we now
host one million mailing list subscriptions. Our birds are hard at work
to upgrade our list server with new features and higher capacity.

On the other hand, our huge backlog of help ticket requests cannot be
solved with more servers. The tickets are consuming a rapidly expanding
amount of our limited time. We have a plan! We are working on a new
system which will hopefully allow help requests to become more of a
community effort. When the system is ready to test, you will be the
first to know.

## what the heck is https?

When you open up a web page, the location bar will typically begin with
"http://". If you are viewing the page using a secure connection, the
the location bar will begin with "https://";.

Note the 's' at the end of the http. The 's' is for 'secure'. Also,
there will be a little lock icon in the location bar or in the lower
corner of your browser window. If your connection is not secure, people
can listen in on your email and your passwords as they are transmitted
in plain text. When it *is* secure, the data sent between your computer
and riseup.net is encrypted.

Soon, we are going to make it so that if you go to mail.riseup.net or
lists.riseup.net, only https will work. If you want to use plain http
(without the little 's'), then you will need to use the domain
insecure.mail.riseup.net or insecure.lists.riseup.net.

Why would you want to use insecure.mail.riseup.net? You don't! But some
web browsers are so old that they cannot work properly with a secure
connection. You would only use this if nothing else worked and you
didn't care if someone hacked your account, stole your personal
information, read all those racy love letters you are sending, and
infiltrated your plans for that direct action you've been planning all year.

This only affects the website: your email address will stay the same.

To prepare for this transition, you should head on over to
http://help.riseup.net/certs. This page will walk you through the
process of making your web browser or mail client work well with the
riseup certificates used for secure connections. Please read
http://help.riseup.net/security for more information on communication
privacy.

## worst internet law ever?

On August 3, the US Senate ratified the Convention on Cybercrime[1].
This paves the way for greater international cooperation on
cybersecurity issues... doesn't sound so bad until you hear that the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) calls this "the world's worst
internet law."

According to the EFF[2]:

> The treaty requires that the U.S. government help enforce other
> countries' 'cybercrime' laws--even if the act being prosecuted is not
> illegal in the United States(!!) That means that countries that have
> laws limiting free speech on the Net could oblige the F.B.I. to
> uncover the identities of anonymous U.S. critics, or monitor their
> communications on behalf of foreign governments. American ISPs would
> be obliged to obey other jurisdictions' requests to log their users'
> behavior without due process, or compensation.

Unlike in the EU, the law in the US still allows for the general
practice of keeping no logs. In fact, we have developed a lot of
software to make this possible[3]. However, this law could make it so
that we might be ordered to begin logging at the behest of a foreign
government.

As usual, we will keep you updated on this law and our evolving police
state.

## support your friendly neighborhood tech collective!

It is like this: You donate and riseup.net stays alive. You don't
donate, and we fade away to that internet castle in the sky crowded with
failed dot coms and last year's gadgets. Save us from that fate!

You might ask yourself "why should I pay for something I can get for
free from gmail/yahoogroups/hotmail/aol?" The answer is quite simple: it
ain't free! Society pays when you use a service designed to sell
advertising and create consumer desire, society pays when you depend on
infrastructure which censors political speech[1], shuts down political
lists[2], and cooperates with the government to track your
associations[3] and jail dissidents[4]. When you use those services, you
aid in their project of world domination. Don't do it!

So, do yourself a favor: visit http://riseup.net/donate and empty your
piggy bank.

In solidarity,
the riseup collective
