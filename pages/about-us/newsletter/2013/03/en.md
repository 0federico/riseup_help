## We need to talk about Facebook

We have tech collective allies all over the globe. One of these groups posted a compelling critique of activists using Facebook. While we Riseup birds may agree with some, all, or most of the piece, we think it is a nice conversation starter. So this month, please pass this along to your friends, comrades, allies, collective members, volunteers, staff members - whomever you organize with.

## Reducing Riseup stress

Yeah, money sucks. But it does exist and Riseup and the services we provide are in many ways dependent upon having a steady stream (or trickle) of donations. Every little bit (and byte) does help us out! Thank you for all the monthly sustainer donations - these regular, steady donations help keep our stress down!
