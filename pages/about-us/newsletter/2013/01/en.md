## Thank you!

Yes, thanks to you!  By using Riseup, you continue a commitment to fostering autonomous communication systems for social justice.  While there are more choices than ever for how to communicate, when you use a service like Riseup, you put your bits and bytes behind your political principles.

And, thank you to all the people who make Riseup possible. We have countless people around the globe who are helping out in a myriad of ways. Thank you to the folks answering help tickets, the people translating our newsletters and our documentation, those working on keeping our servers running, people who make sure our server bills get paid on time, the coders working tirelessly to improve our services, the partners who make us dinner and the users who send us lovely notes telling us about how our services have helped in some small way to make the world a better place.

## A friendly reminder about phishing

Please, no matter how intriguing, convincing or confusing an email request for your account details may be, never give over your  password information.  We have a handy page that details more about the phenomenon of phishing – basically where bad robots and people seek to gain access to your account.  Riseup will never send you an email asking for your account information – if you see one, this is because unfortunately a phishing spam email got through our defenses. For more information see our page on [[phishing]].

## Don't forget about the help pages

Please remember we have extensive help pages available.  This year we aim to expand the translation of these pages. If you have a technical question or problem, please stop by the help pages to see if your question has been previously answered.  If your problem is still not answered, then "fill out a help ticket":https://help.riseup.net so we can work to resolve your problem.

## New year? How about a recurring donation?

Last newsletter we gave a big shout out to all the folks around the world who continue to sustain Riseup by donating money. Once again, thank you. We have a variety of ways to make it easy for you to contribute money. One of our favorite ways is the recurring payment. Some steady, predictable income helps us tremendously. Plus, you won’t need to remember to donate and we won’t need to remind you. For added fun and flexibility, you can choose a cycle of once a year, twice a year, four times a year, or monthly. https://riseup.net/donate
