Mutual aid makes your email sparkle!
------------------------------------

There is no such thing as free email. Services like gmail, hotmail, and yahoo make their money from surveillance: they build a profile on your behavior and your desires and then bombard you with advertising specifically targeted to you.

Riseup.net is different. This service is a labor of love by activists like you committed to building movement-run and secure alternative infrastructure. Riseup.net email was our first project *and* has grown over these decades to be a very special service that social justice activists use globally. As reminder, here’s some of the features that makes your Riseup.net email service fabulous:

(1) Full disk encryption
(2) Personally encrypted email storage
(3) All services are encrypted
(4) All services have Tor Onion Services
(5) Client-side end-to-end encryption with webmail
(6) We encrypt traffic whenever possible
(7) Delivery to other providers over Tor
(8) We don’t disclose your location to email recipients.
(9) We don’t log your internet address

The riseup.net email service takes a lot of time and money to keep running and is funded entirely by small donations from its users. Please do your part and contribute today at https://riseup.net/donate

In solidarity,
