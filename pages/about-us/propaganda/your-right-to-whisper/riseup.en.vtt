00:01.879 --> 00:04.620
We live in a time of instantaneous communication,

00:06.230 --> 00:07.680
tech-driven convenience

00:09.420 --> 00:11.229
and global inter-connectivity.

00:13.045 --> 00:13.879
Not to mention...

00:14.800 --> 00:17.440
historically unprecedented surveillance.

00:19.859 --> 00:23.219
Our societies are increasingly
shaped by digitial infrastructure

00:23.720 --> 00:26.420
owned and controlled
by monolithic corporations.

00:27.470 --> 00:29.691
There's a reason that
companies like Google and Facebook

00:29.691 --> 00:31.290
are worth billions of dollars.

00:33.070 --> 00:36.775
The supposedly 'free' nature
of the services that theey provide

00:36.775 --> 00:39.749
is merely a distraction
that hides their true cost.

00:41.153 --> 00:43.980
Did you ever tell someone
a secret when you were a kid,

00:43.980 --> 00:46.230
only to have your whole class find out?

00:47.562 --> 00:49.088
Not a great feeling, right?

00:50.340 --> 00:53.020
Today, surveillance capitalists
have made a business out of gathering

00:53.020 --> 00:55.183
and telling our secrets

00:55.893 --> 00:58.695
recording everything that we do
and selling that information

00:58.695 --> 01:00.838
to anyone who can afford to pay.

01:01.658 --> 01:05.797
For some, this can look like
strangely well-informed advertisements

01:05.797 --> 01:07.496
appearing on your newsfeed.

01:07.496 --> 01:10.663
For others, it can look like
state security agents

01:10.663 --> 01:14.487
showing up at your door,
or kidnapping you off the street.

01:15.115 --> 01:18.697
We all deserve free
accessible, and secure communications.

01:19.819 --> 01:22.805
Riseup is one of the few
providers who actively works

01:22.805 --> 01:25.809
to protect our
collective ability to whisper,

01:26.429 --> 01:30.714
to think and to act with a
reasonable expectation of privacy.

01:32.933 --> 01:36.368
We will never sell, mine
or exploit your data - 

01:37.093 --> 01:38.868
we'll help keep your secrets,

01:39.568 --> 01:42.116
so that you can focus
on the fight against oppression

01:42.576 --> 01:44.662
and for collective liberation.

01:46.945 --> 01:49.556
We can't do this without your help.

01:49.556 --> 01:52.293
Maintaining movement infrastructure
costs money,

01:52.293 --> 01:55.178
but we believe 
it is a whorthwhile investment.

01:55.178 --> 01:59.685
If you believe in what we do and
are in a position to donate, please do.

02:00.931 --> 02:04.080
Your donations will help us to
provide access and protections

02:04.080 --> 02:06.588
to those in more vulnerable conditions.

02:07.108 --> 02:10.335
Together we can keep Riseup's
communications online, free

02:10.335 --> 02:12.504
and accessible for everyone.
