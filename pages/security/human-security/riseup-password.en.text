h2. Riseup accounts

Some Riseup services use separate and independent accounts (each with their own username and password).

* *Primary Riseup Account*: This login and password is used for email, VPN, and chat. Your settings can be changed at https://account.riseup.net.
* *Mailing List Account*: If you are subscribed to any mailing list at https://lists.riseup.net, you have a mailing list account. Your settings for this account can be changed at https://lists.riseup.net.
* *Groups Account*: If you use https://we.riseup.net, your account for this website is independent of your primary Riseup account or your list account. In the future, we will merge the Groups accounts and the Primary accounts.
