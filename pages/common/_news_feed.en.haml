  .label.label-danger New Tor addresses issued
  .date 2014-04-07

    Due to a [[security vulnerability disclosed on the internet today => https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160/]], we had to roll our tor
 hidden service addresses. This means that if you were using a Tor hidden service to connect to Riseup, you will not be able to continue to use that address. P
lease find out the [[new hidden service address => /security/network-security/tor#riseups-tor-hidden-services]] and replace the old one you were using with the
 new one to continue to use Riseup's Tor hidden services!
