K-9 Mail is an free software mail application for Android. The app is a more functional replacement for the default mail application included on most phones. It supports both POP3 and IMAP mailboxes.

You can install K-9 from Google Play, https://f-droid.org, or the "K-9 website":https://code.google.com/p/k9mail.

We have no tutorial written yet for configuring K-9 with Riseup. You can help by contributing one!
